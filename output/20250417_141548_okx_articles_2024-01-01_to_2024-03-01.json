This will prohibit trades **between the same master account, between\nsub-accounts under the same master account, and between the same master\naccount and its affiliated sub-accounts**. For example, if master account A\nhas 2 sub-accounts, A1 and A2, trades between the following accounts will be\nprohibited:\n\n  * A with A\n  * A1 with A1\n  * A2 with A2\n  * A with A1\n  * A with A2\n  * A1 with A2\n\n**Key reminders:**\n\n  * The default STP mode will cancel maker orders. If a taker order leads to self-trading, the maker order on the order book will be canceled, while the taker order will match with subsequent orders.\n  * API users can select alternative STP modes by using the `stpMode` parameter with their new orders via the API endpoints for certain order types. Refer to the API documentation for details.\n  * Self-trades may still occur between orders created before and after mandatory STP implementation.\n  * For block trading, the maker will not receive the RFQ if the taker is under the same master account.\n  * You can find orders canceled due to STP by going to Order history on the OKX website or app. API users can query Order history REST endpoints or subscribe to the Orders WebSocket channel for this information.\n\n**Further references:**\n\n  * [Introducing Self-Trade Prevention: Better trading efficiency and protection for API users](/en-eu/help/how-do-i-prevent-self-trade-and-improve-my-api-trading-efficiency-and)\n  * [Mandatory STP - API upcoming changes](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-enabling-self-trade-prevention-by-default)\n\nOKX team\n\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\n",

    "body": "This week, between 9:07 and 9:09 am UTC on January 23, 2024, OKB spot trading\npairs experienced abnormal price volatility on our platform. This incident\nstarted when a substantially leveraged spot position was liquidated, which led\nto a domino effect liquidating multiple positions within flexible loan,\nmargined spot trading, and multi-currency margin trading products. Some of our\ncustomers who had open trades or were part of the force liquidation were\nimpacted.\n\nAs we advised [here](/en-eu/help/okx-to-adjust-discount-rates-for-several-\nassets-2024-01-24), OKX has adjusted its relevant risk parameters and we will\nadjust the accounts of eligible users that were impacted.\n\nSome of the eligible cases for account adjustment may include:\n\n  * Margined spot positions long OKB\n  * Flexible Loan with OKB as a collateral\n  * Cross positions with OKB margined under multi-currency margin accounts\n\nWe will automatically deposit funds into eligible users' funding accounts in\nUSDT before February 1, 2024.\n\n**Adjustment rules and calculation parameters**\n\nAccount adjustment for eligible users (to be determined at OKX's sole\ndiscretion) will cover the price difference loss, as calculated by OKX, that\nresulted from forced selling of OKB at a lower price during a liquidation and\nany liquidation penalties and transaction fees associated with the\nliquidation. For loans and positions with multiple collateral that included\nOKB, liquidation penalties and trading fees that were charged for the sale of\nthe other collateral or positions will also be reimbursed, subject to OKX's\ndiscretion. Bankruptcy losses covered by the insurance fund will be excluded.\n\n**A price difference loss** refers to a loss caused by the difference between\nthe mark price at 9:07:26am UTC (48.36 USDT) and the resulting liquidation\nprices during the period.\n\nFor example: If 10 OKB was liquidated at a liquidation price of 40.0 USDT, OKX\nwill compensate difference of (48.36 - 40.0) * 10 = 83.6 USDT. Compensation\nwill also include the associated liquidation penalty and trading fees (as\ndetermined by OKX), and exclude any bankruptcy losses already covered by the\ninsurance fund.\n\nFor any additional inquiries regarding adjustment or eligibility, please\ncontact us via the [Support Center](/en-eu/help).\n\nKind regards,\n\nOKX Team\n\n**Note: Not all users who held positions during the volatility period will be\ncompensated, only users who are determined to be eligible based on the above\noutlined criteria will be compensated.\n\n",

    "title": "OKX to change funding fee collection mechanism for remaining group of perpetual futures",
    "body": "To provide you with better services, OKX will gradually change the funding fee\ncollection mechanism for the remaining group of perpetual futures from cross-\nperiod collection to current-period collection. Perpetual futures that have\nalready changed to the current-period collection mechanism are listed in the\nfollowing announcement: [https://www.okx.com/help/okx-to-change-funding-fee-\ncollection-mechanism](/en-eu/help/okx-to-change-funding-fee-collection-\nmechanism)\n\n **Before the change:  \n** Formerly, funding fee calculations were based on the funding rate of the\nprevious funding period (cross-period collection). For example, when the\nfunding fee is collected every 8 hours, funding fee calculations at 8:00 am\nUTC today use the funding rate determined by the premium index from 4:00 pm\nUTC yesterday to 12:00 am UTC today, resulting in a fixed value from 12:00 am\nUTC to 8:00 am UTC.  \n  \n **After the change:  \n** Funding fee calculations will be based on the funding rate of the current\nfunding period (current-period collection).For example, funding fee\ncalculations at 8:00 am UTC every day will use the funding rate determined by\nthe premium index from 12:00 am UTC to 8:00 am UTC. Note that the funding rate\nmay fluctuate before the funding fee is collected, so you need to dynamically\nmanage your positions according to current conditions.\n\n **Affected futures:**\n\n **Date and time: January 31, 2024, 4:00 pm UTC**\n\n **145 USDT-margined perpetual futures:**\n\nMATICUSDT\n\n|\n\nAUCTIONUSDT\n\n|\n\nCROUSDT\n\n|\n\nGALAUSDT\n\n|\n\nKLAYUSDT\n\n|\n\nMOVRUSDT\n\n|\n\nSANDUSDT\n\n|\n\nWAVESUSDT  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nDOGEUSDT\n\n|\n\nAVAXUSDT\n\n|\n\nCRVUSDT\n\n|\n\nGALUSDT\n\n|\n\nKNCUSDT\n\n|\n\nNEARUSDT\n\n|\n\nSHIBUSDT\n\n|\n\nWAXPUSDT  \n  \nSATSUSDT\n\n|\n\nAXSUSDT\n\n|\n\nCSPRUSDT\n\n|\n\nGASUSDT\n\n|\n\nKSMUSDT\n\n|\n\nNEOUSDT\n\n|\n\nSLPUSDT\n\n|\n\nWOOUSDT  \n  \n1INCHUSDT\n\n|\n\nBADGERUSDT\n\n|\n\nCTCUSDT\n\n|\n\nGFTUSDT\n\n|\n\nLDOUSDT\n\n|\n\nNFTUSDT\n\n|\n\nSNXUSDT\n\n|\n\nWSMUSDT  \n  \nAAVEUSDT\n\n|\n\nBALUSDT\n\n|\n\nCVCUSDT\n\n|\n\nGMTUSDT\n\n|\n\nLINKUSDT\n\n|\n\nNMRUSDT\n\n|\n\nSSVUSDT\n\n|\n\nXCHUSDT  \n  \nACEUSDT\n\n|\n\nBANDUSDT\n\n|\n\nDOTUSDT\n\n|\n\nGMXUSDT\n\n|\n\nLOOKSUSDT\n\n|\n\nOMGUSDT\n\n|\n\nSTARLUSDT\n\n|\n\nXLMUSDT  \n  \nADAUSDT\n\n|\n\nBATUSDT\n\n|\n\nDYDXUSDT\n\n|\n\nGODSUSDT\n\n|\n\nLPTUSDT\n\n|\n\nONTUSDT\n\n|\n\nSTORJUSDT\n\n|\n\nXTZUSDT  \n  \nAGIXUSDT\n\n|\n\nBICOUSDT\n\n|\n\nEGLDUSDT\n\n|\n\nGRTUSDT\n\n|\n\nLQTYUSDT\n\n|\n\nORBSUSDT\n\n|\n\nSTXUSDT\n\n|\n\nYFIUSDT  \n  \nAGLDUSDT\n\n|\n\nBIGTIMEUSDT\n\n|\n\nENSUSDT\n\n|\n\nHBARUSDT\n\n|\n\nLRCUSDT\n\n|\n\nPEPEUSDT\n\n|\n\nSUSHIUSDT\n\n|\n\nYFIIUSDT  \n  \nAIDOGEUSDT\n\n|\n\nBNTUSDT\n\n|\n\nEOSUSDT\n\n|\n\nICPUSDT\n\n|\n\nLTCUSDT\n\n|\n\nPERPUSDT\n\n|\n\nSWEATUSDT\n\n|\n\nYGGUSDT  \n  \nALGOUSDT\n\n|\n\nBONKUSDT\n\n|\n\nETHWUSDT\n\n|\n\nIDUSDT\n\n|\n\nLUNAUSDT\n\n|\n\nPYTHUSDT\n\n|\n\nTHETAUSDT\n\n|\n\nZILUSDT  \n  \nALPHAUSDT\n\n|\n\nBSVUSDT\n\n|\n\nFETUSDT\n\n|\n\nIMXUSDT\n\n|\n\nLUNCUSDT\n\n|\n\nQTUMUSDT\n\n|\n\nTONUSDT\n\n|\n\nZRXUSDT  \n  \nANTUSDT\n\n|\n\nCELOUSDT\n\n|\n\nFILUSDT\n\n|\n\nINJUSDT\n\n|\n\nMAGICUSDT\n\n|\n\nRACAUSDT\n\n|\n\nTRXUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nAPEUSDT\n\n|\n\nCELUSDT\n\n|\n\nFITFIUSDT\n\n|\n\nIOSTUSDT\n\n|\n\nMANAUSDT\n\n|\n\nRDNTUSDT\n\n|\n\nTURBOUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nAPI3USDT\n\n|\n\nCETUSUSDT\n\n|\n\nFLMUSDT\n\n|\n\nIOTAUSDT\n\n|\n\nMASKUSDT\n\n|\n\nRENUSDT\n\n|\n\nUMAUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nAPTUSDT\n\n|\n\nCFXUSDT\n\n|\n\nFLOKIUSDT\n\n|\n\nJOEUSDT\n\n|\n\nMEMEUSDT\n\n|\n\nRNDRUSDT\n\n|\n\nUNIUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nARUSDT\n\n|\n\nCHZUSDT\n\n|\n\nFRONTUSDT\n\n|\n\nJSTUSDT\n\n|\n\nMETISUSDT\n\n|\n\nRONUSDT\n\n|\n\nUSDCUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nARBUSDT\n\n|\n\nCOMPUSDT\n\n|\n\nFTMUSDT\n\n|\n\nJTOUSDT\n\n|\n\nMINAUSDT\n\n|\n\nRSRUSDT\n\n|\n\nUSTCUSDT\n\n|  \n  \nATOMUSDT\n\n|\n\nCOREUSDT\n\n|\n\nFXSUSDT\n\n|\n\nKISHUUSDT\n\n|\n\nMKRUSDT\n\n|\n\nRVNUSDT\n\n|\n\nVRAUSDT\n\n|  \n  \n **25 Crypto-margined perpetual futures:**\n\nXRPUSD\n\n|\n\nAVAXUSD\n\n|\n\nEOSUSD\n\n|\n\nLTCUSD\n\n|\n\nTHETAUSD  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n1INCHUSD\n\n|\n\nBCHUSD\n\n|\n\nETCUSD\n\n|\n\nMANAUSD\n\n|\n\nTRXUSD  \n  \nADAUSD\n\n|\n\nBSVUSD\n\n|\n\nGRTUSD\n\n|\n\nNEOUSD\n\n|\n\nUNIUSD  \n  \nALGOUSD\n\n|\n\nCRVUSD\n\n|\n\nKSMUSD\n\n|\n\nSANDUSD\n\n|\n\nXLMUSD  \n  \nATOMUSD\n\n|\n\nDOTUSD\n\n|\n\nLINKUSD\n\n|\n\nSUSHIUSD\n\n|\n\nYFIUSD  \n  \n **Funding fee collection before and after the change:**\n\nFunding fee collection\n\n|\n\nPremium index period used for funding rate calculations  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nJanuary 31, 2024, 8:00 am UTC\n\n|\n\nJanuary 30, 2024, 4:00 pm UTC -

    "title": "OKX to adjust the minimum order quantities for several futures",
    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust ‌the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **6:00 am - 10:00 am UTC on March\n14, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to ‌step size will also be implemented.  \nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts) (After)  \n---|---|---|---  \nExpiry | LTCUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | LTCUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | SHIBUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [Trading rules](/en-\neu/trade-market/info/swap)  \n  \nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n  \n**1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**  \nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1\nETH, the updated step size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum\nfluctuation in the contracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01\nETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH\nand a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity is set at 1\ncontract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be greater than or\nequal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in increments based on\n‌step size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so on.\n\n  \n**2\\. Display rules for open positions and open orders**  \nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.  \nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).  \n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n  \n**3\\. Order processing rules**  \nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.  \nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).  \nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).  \n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n  \n**4\\. API interface adjustment rules**  \nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).  \nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)\n\n  \nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

Reward distribution time depends on the monthly epoch, which is set by the Aptos network and is dynamic.

Redemption takes anywhere from 1-30 days, based on the time between your redemption time and the time of the Aptos Network's epoch. Afterwards, your APT will be redeemed from the chain and distributed to your funding account. There are no rewards during the redemption period.\n  2. If you redeem the principal before the reward distribution date, OKX will calculate rewards based on the actual number of days staked and distribute them to your funding account on the reward distribution day.\n\n#### Disclaimer\n\n  1. As Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms vary for different tokens, it's important to fully understand the rules and details of each project before subscribing. These include, but aren't limited to minimum redemption amounts, interest accrual start times, reward distribution times, redemption periods, and expected annualized earnings. \n  2.

    "body": "OKX is launching an exclusive airdrop campaign for SOL, DOT, MATIC and TRX\nOnchain Earn products users on **January 11, 2024 at 12:00 am UTC**.\n\n**Campaign details**  \n **1\\. Eligibility**\n\n  * Campaign period: January 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) to January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC).\n  * Users must stake the airdrop tokens in the following amounts to receive any rewards：\n    * SOL: at least 1 SOL\n    * DOT: at least 2 DOT\n    * MATIC: at least 1 MATIC\n    * TRX: at least 20 TRX\n\n**2\\. Rules**\n\n  * Before the campaign starts, we'll take a snapshot of your SOL, DOT, MATIC, and TRX On-chain Earn subscriptions on January 11, 2024 at 06:00 (UTC). This snapshot will determine your baseline holdings.\n  * We'll take daily snapshots (taken at 12:00 UTC) of your On-chain Earn subscriptions during the campaign period. The average increased subscription amount from the baseline snapshot, or \"average increment\" will determine the size of your rewards. This means you must stake as much as possible as early as possible during the campaign period to maximize your rewards.\n\n**3\\. Reward calculations**\n\n  * Your airdrop reward = (Your average increment) / (Total average increment) × (Prize pool)\n  * Example (for illustrative purposes only):\n    * User A has 5 SOL staked during the initial snapshot taken on January 11.\n    * He stakes 5 SOL on the first day of the 14-day campaign, giving him a total of 10 SOL.\n    * He stakes another 5 SOL on day 7 of the campaign, giving him a total of 15 SOL. He does nothing else for the remainder of the campaign.\n    * User A's average increment is calculated as follows:\n      * (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15) / 14 - 5 = 7.5 SOL.\n    * Assuming that the total average increment of users participating in the campaign is 1,000 SOL, and the prize pool is 10,000 SOL, user A's airdrop rewards will be calculated as follows:\n      * User A's airdrop rewards = (7.5 SOL) / (1,000 SOL) × (10,000 SOL) = 75 SOL\n\n**4\\. Schedule and prize details**\n\nCampaign period | Prize pool | Token  \n---|---|---  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 250 SOL |\nSOL  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 14,000\nMATIC | MATIC  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 2,000 DOT\n| DOT  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 250,000\nTRX | TRX  \n  \n**5\\. Reward distribution**\n\n  * You'll receive your airdrop rewards within 15 working days in the form of a free On-chain Earn subscription after the campaign period ends. The prize will be labeled \"airdrop reward\". \n  * All On-chain Earn staking interest will be distributed to your funding account depending on each token's on-chain mechanism.\n  * OKX has the discretion to convert any rewards into platform vouchers or USDT of equivalent value or less value. This may happen in cases where platform restrictions in certain jurisdictions cause participants to be ineligible for certain campaign rewards, where OKX is unable to procure the prizes for the participants, or in any case that OKX deems in its full discretion that it's necessary for the rewards to be converted.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n  * OKX and collaborated third-party providers provide node setup, operation, and maintenance services for On-chain Earn product staking, and bear all related costs. On-chain Earn product staking rewards are subject to fluctuations, and will be distributed based on ‌on-chain conditions.\n  * Participation with sub-accounts is forbidden.\n\n**Terms and conditions:**\n\n  1. By default, users who enter the campaign page and participate in this campaign have read and understood the Terms and Conditions of this campaign.\n  2.

The update is scheduled for 8:00 am\nUTC on March 5, 2024 and will not affect other calculation logic or change the\noutcome during funding rate settlement.\n\n  \nFunding rate formula:\n\nFunding rate = Clamp[Average premium index, Funding cap, Funding floor]  \nTo elaborate further,  \nAverage premium index = MA(Premium index – Interest rate)  \nInterest rate = 0  \nPremium index = [(Best bid + Best offer) / 2 – Index price] / Index price  \nMA refers to the moving average and it is calculated every minute\n\n  \n **Before the switch：**\n\nFunding rate will be calculated using the premium index of each minute from\nthe start of the period to present. Example (in 24-hour time):\n\n **Most recent settlement time**\n\n|\n\n **Current time**\n\n|\n\n **Timeframe used to calculate funding rate**  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n16:00\n\n|\n\n16:10\n\n|\n\n16:00 - 16:10  \n  \n16:00\n\n|\n\n17:00\n\n|\n\n16:00 - 17:00  \n  \n16:00\n\n|\n\n23:59\n\n|\n\n16:00 - 23:59  \n  \n00:00\n\n|\n\n01:00\n\n|\n\n00:00 - 01:00  \n  \n  \n **After the switch:**\n\nFunding rate will be calculated using premium index of each minute over the\nlast N hours till present.  \nTo elaborate further,  \n“N hours” refers to the number of hours between each settlement period. If\nfunding fees are settled every 8 hours, N = 8.\n\n **Most recent settlement time**\n\n|\n\n **Current time**\n\n|\n\n **Timeframe used to calculate funding rate**  \n  \n---|---|---  \n  \n16:00\n\n|\n\n16:10\n\n|\n\n08:11 - 16:10  \n  \n16:00\n\n|\n\n17:00\n\n|\n\n09:01 - 17:00  \n  \n **16:00**\n\n|\n\n **23:59**\n\n|\n\n **16:00 - 23:59 (Same timeframe is used before and after the switch)**  \n  \n00:00\n\n|\n\n01:00\n\n|\n\n17:01 - 01:00  \n  \n  \n **Impact after the switch:**\n\nFor perpetual futures that use current-cycle settlement, the current funding\nrate at 23:59 will be used to settle funding fees at 00:00. There will not be\nany difference in the outcome before and after the switch during settlement.  \nFor perpetual futures that use cross-cycle settlement, it will only affect the\nnext funding rate calculations and will not affect how the current funding\nrate is calculated.  \n\n **API interface**\n\nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/funding-rate) and the\nWebsocket channel (funding-rate) will follow the rules mentioned above.\n\n **Method**\n\n|\n\n **Field**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nnext_period\n\n|\n\nnextFundingRate  \n  \ncurrent_period\n\n|\n\nfundingRate  \n  \n  \nThank you for your understanding and support.
