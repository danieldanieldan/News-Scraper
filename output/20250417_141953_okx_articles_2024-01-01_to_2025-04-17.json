Naturally, our customers who reside in markets where\nlocal laws limit new listings are left disappointed when a highly anticipated\nnew listing is not accessible or has limited availability.\n\nOur priority is to always follow local laws. It makes us and our services more\nreliable and dependable. To help avoid disappointment in the future, we will\ndo a better job of communicating as much as possible on the exact availability\nof any new listing.\n\nWe thrive to make crypto more accessible while following local laws and\nregulations. We also value our community's feedback and we will improve our\ncustomer communications going forward, so we are able to inform you about our\nlistings with more details.\n\nThank you,  \nOKX Customer Experience Team\n\n",

If you need to\nback up your data, you may download it ‌through the report center on the OKX\nwebsite.\n\nIn order to ensure the successful delivery of the above-mentioned perpetual\nfutures during the delisting, the following adjustments are made to our risk\ncontrol parameters:\n\n  1.

Each crypto pair\nwill take around 1 hour to suspend. Users with borrowings or collateral of the\nabove crypto pairs in margin trading and flexible loans should make sure to\nrepay before the delisting times. A forced payment will be triggered if unpaid\nborrowings remain due by the delisting time.\n\nPlease note: Prices may experience extreme fluctuations. To avoid losses\ncaused by forced repayment, we recommend you stop trading the pairs listed\nabove and close all underlying positions in advance.\n\n  3.

Due to\nsignificant differences in market liquidity of each currency, our platform\ncalculates the actual USD value of certain crypto based on certain discount\nrates to balance market risks.  \nLearn more: [https://www.okx.com/trade-market/discountrate](/en-eu/trade-\nmarket/discountrate)\n\nOKX team  \nJuly 1, 2024\n\n",

Order history and\nbilling records will still be available after the delisting. If you need to\nback up your data, you may download it ‌through the report center on the OKX\nwebsite.  \nIn order to ensure the successful delivery of the above-mentioned perpetual\nfutures during the delisting, the following adjustments are made to our risk\ncontrol parameters:\n\n  1. Adjustment of price limit rules  \nHow the limit price is calculated:\n\nPeriod | Highest price limit | Lowest price limit  \n---|---|---  \nWithin 10 minutes of contract generation | Index × (1 + X) | Index × (1 – X)  \n10 minutes after contract generation | Min[Max(Index, Index × (1 + Y) +\nAverage premium over the 10 minutes), Index × (1 + Z)] | Max[Min(Index, Index\n× (1 – Y) + Average premium over the past 10 minutes), Index × (1 – Z)]  \n  \n\nAdjusted price limit rules:\n\nTime | X | Y | Z  \n---|---|---|---  \n48 hours before delivery | 2% | 2% | 5%  \n30 minutes before delivery | 1% | 1% | 2%  \n  \nNote: If there is a deviation from the contract price before then, the price\nlimit will be adjusted according to market conditions.\n\n  2.

    "body": "Dear OKX traders,\n\n  \nTo provide a better trading experience and optimize fund utilization, OKX will\nlaunch a daily settlement mechanism for **ETH-USD, ETH-USDT, BTC-USDT,** and\n**BTC-USD** expiry futures contracts in cross-margin mode.  \n\n  * For **ETH-USD & ETH-USDT **expiry futures contracts, the daily settlement mechanism will start from **08:00 am UTC on March 22, 2025**.\n\n  * The launch date for the daily settlement mechanism of **BTC-USDT** and **BTC-USD** expiry futures contracts is pending and will be announced separately.\n\n  \n **How it works:** Settlement will happen daily at 08:00 am UTC. Upon\nsettlement, the position’s settlement PnL will be credited to your account\nbalance, and the position’s entry price will be updated to the last settlement\nprice. The position’s floating PnL will be calculated based on the updated\nentry price. You won’t be charged any fees for settlement and your position\nsize won’t be affected. The settlement price is calculated by averaging the\nmark prices from the last hour before settlement. Note that these updates to\nsettlement are only applicable to cross-margin positions.  \n  \nFor more details on the settlement mechanism, you can refer to the following\ndocument:  \nProduct Document: [Introduction to the settlement mechanism](/en-\neu/help/introduction-to-settlement-mechanism)  \nAPI Changes: [Expiry futures daily settlement](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-\nchanges-expiry-futures-daily-settlement)\n\n **Risk notice: OKX reserves the right to temporarily close the daily\nsettlement mechanism without prior notice due to market risks and re-open it\nafter assessing the risk.**  \n  \nThank you for your continued support, and we hope these updates will improve\nyour overall trading experience.  \n\nOKX team\n\nMar 8, 2025\n\n",

If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01)\n\n    1. Limit orders: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your pending order will not be canceled. For example, if tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, open order 130.2442 will be canceled and open order 130.2400 will not be canceled.\n\n    2. Trading bots: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will not be canceled. For example, if the tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, limit order 130.2442 will be canceled and limit order 130.2400 will not be canceled.\n\n      1. For grid and DCA bots, any open orders you have already placed with a trading bot will be canceled first (including spot grid, futures grid, moon grid, infinity grid, spot DCA, and futures DCA), then the bots will be stopped.\n\n      2. For all other bots and order types (including signal bot, recurring buy, TWAP, iceberg, smart portfolio, arbitrage, stop, trailing stop, and trigger), your open orders will be canceled first, but the bots will not be affected. Your bots will resume trading with the new tick size after trading resumes.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001)\n\n    1. After the adjustment, open orders will be filled according to the adjusted tick size.\n\n **Note: The above rules are also applicable to orders placed using API.**\n\nAfter the tick size is adjusted (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01), if you place an\norder with the previous tick size (0.0001) via API, the system will\nautomatically round down buy orders and round up sell orders so that the order\ncan be successfully placed. However, you will not be able to place orders\nusing the pre-adjusted tick size on the normal web and mobile interface.\n\n **2) Open orders and the display of historical orders**\n\n  1. If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01): For non-API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the adjusted tick size by rounding down the buy orders and rounding up the sell orders. For API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed as the pre-adjustment tick size.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001): Open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the original tick size.\n\nYou are encouraged to adjust your trading strategies based on the above\nchanges.\n\n **Risk warning:** The foregoing overview and information, some of which may\nbe provided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and\neducational purposes only.

If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01)\n\n    1. Limit orders: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your pending order will not be canceled. For example, if tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, open order 130.2442 will be canceled and open order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n    2. Trading bots: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will not be canceled. For example, if the tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, limit order 130.2442 will be canceled and limit order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n      1. For grid and DCA bots, any open orders you have already placed with a trading bot will be canceled first (including spot grid, futures grid, moon grid, infinity grid, spot DCA, and futures DCA), then the bots will be stopped.\n\n      2. For all other bots and order types (including signal bot, recurring buy, TWAP, iceberg, smart portfolio, arbitrage, stop, trailing stop, and trigger), your open orders will be canceled first, but the bots will not be affected. Your bots will resume trading with the new tick size after trading resumes.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001)\n\n    1. After the adjustment, open orders will be filled according to the adjusted tick size.\n\n **Note: The above rules are also applicable to orders placed using API.**\n\nAfter the tick size is adjusted (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01), if you place an\norder with the previous tick size (0.0001) via API, the system will\nautomatically round down buy orders and round up sell orders so that the order\ncan be successfully placed. However, you will not be able to place orders\nusing the pre-adjusted tick size on the normal web and mobile interface.\n\n **2) Open orders and the display of historical orders**\n\n  1. If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01): For non-API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the adjusted tick size by rounding down the buy orders and rounding up the sell orders. For API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed as the pre-adjustment tick size.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001): Open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the original tick size.\n\nYou are encouraged to adjust your trading strategies based on the above\nchanges.\n\n **Risk warning:** The foregoing overview and information, some of which may\nbe provided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and\neducational purposes only.

    "title": "Updates to the spot cost price feature",
    "body": "We’ve introduced a few updates to our spot cost price feature to further\nenhance your trading experience. These updates aim to give traders greater\nflexibility, control, and accuracy when managing and tracking trading\nperformance. The updates are as follows:  \n\n **1\\. Edit feature for spot cost price**\n\nThis feature allows you to manually edit the cost price of a token. After\nmodification, the cost price will be updated to the value you set, and both\nthe PnL and PnL Ratio will adjust accordingly. Future changes to the cost\nprice resulting from spot trading will also be based on the edited cost price.\n\n **For example:** If your trading account holds 1 BTC with a cost price of\n60,000, and you transfer another 1 BTC from your funding account, your trading\naccount will now hold a total of 2 BTC. If you then edit the cost price to\n61,000, the cost price of the 2 BTC in your trading account will be updated to\n61,000. Future updates to the cost price will also be based on this edited\nvalue of 61,000.\n\nYou can edit the price by going to **Trade** > **Positions & assets** > **Cost\nprice**.\n\n **2\\. Historical data migration**  \nCurrently, the spot cost price calculation only includes spot trades made from\n12:00 am UTC on August 29, 2024. To improve your experience, we’re migrating\nhistorical data from prior to this date. After the migration, you may\nencounter the following scenarios:\n\n **Scenario**\n\n|\n\n **Explanation**  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe cost price is blank before migration and has a value after.\n\n|\n\nThe platform has automatically calculated the cost price for this token based\non historical data.  \n  \nThe cost price is blank before and after migration.\n\n|\n\nSince there is no cost price in the historical data for this token, the\ninitialized value remains empty.  \n  \nThe cost price value changes after migration.\n\n|\n\n\\- You’re holding crypto from spot trades made before 12:00 am UTC on August\n29, 2024. The cost price now includes data from earlier trades.\n\n\\- You can use the new cost price edit feature to edit the cost price if\nneeded.  \n  \n **3.** **Migration of PnL Data to the Trading Account**  \nStarting from **October 21, 2024** , the platform will gradually migrate the\nPnL sections from the following pages to the **Trading Account**. You can\ncontinue to view spot cost price, corresponding PnL, and PnL Ratio under\n**\"Trading - Positions & Assets\"** or in the **details page of the token**\nwithin the assets section.\n\nThe purpose of this adjustment is to enable more accurate calculations of spot\ncost prices, PnL, and PnL Ratio.\n\nThe Asset Overview page includes data from all accounts, while the spot cost\nprice and PnL data are calculated based on the specific data from the trading\naccount. For instance, assets in the funding account do not affect the\ncalculation of spot cost price and PnL, only the assets in the trading account\ncould be included in the calculation.\n\nThe highlighted sections on the pages below will be phased out.\n\nThank you for your continued support, and we hope these updates will improve\nyour overall trading experience.\n\n  \nOKX team\n\n",

    "title": "OKX to adjust the minimum order quantities for several futures",
    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **6:00 am - 8:00 am UTC on\nOctober 22, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to step size will also be\nimplemented.\n\nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (coins) (Before) | Minimum order\nquantity, step size (contracts) (After) | Minimum order quantity, step size\n(coins) (After)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPerpetual | TURBO/USDT | 1 | 10000 | 0.1 | 1000  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [_**Trad**_](/en-eu/trade-\nmarket/info/spot)[ _ **ing rules**_](/en-eu/trade-market/info/swap)\n\nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n **1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**\n\nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1\nETH, the updated step size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum\nfluctuation in the contracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01\nETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH\nand a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity is set at 1\ncontract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be greater than or\nequal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in increments based on\nstep size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so on.\n\n **2\\. Display rules for open positions and open orders**\n\nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.\n\nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).  \n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n **3\\. Order processing rules**\n\nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.\n\nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).\n\nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).  \n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n **4\\. API interface adjustment rules**\n\nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).\n\nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)  \n\nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

    "body": "To improve user experience, OKX will enhance VIP Loan for traders at the VIP 5\ntier and above at 12:00 am UTC on June 6, 2024. The initial supported\ncurrencies are USDT, USDC, BTC, and ETH.\n\n **Enhanced VIP Loan**\n\nThe enhanced VIP Loan works on a market model, matching borrowing orders\n(taker orders) to lending orders (maker orders). Lenders place orders on the\nSimple Earn order book, specifying an amount and interest rate. Borrowers\nplace orders based on an interest rate, and choose their loan amounts.\nBorrowing orders are matched to lending orders based on the borrower’s\ninterest rate. Once a borrowing order matches one or more lending orders, the\nweighted average interest rate for the lending orders becomes the interest\nrate for the borrowing order.\n\nAfter you create a borrowing order, you can choose to repay or roll over your\nloan at maturity. The enhanced VIP Loan helps you to borrow with increased\npredictability, stability, and flexibility.\n\n **To place a VIP Loan order, follow these steps:**\n\n  1. Go to the Trade page on the Exchange and choose **VIP Loan**. \n\n  2. Choose the crypto you want to borrow.\n\n  3. Enter your expected maximum interest rate on the order placement page. You can check the current marketing interest rate on the **Market overview** page.\n\n  4. After entering an expected maximum interest rate, the estimated amount available for borrowing is displayed. Note that this amount is for reference only, and then adjust the amount you want to borrow.\n\n  5. Make sure the available balance in your trading account can cover the interest, as this will be deducted from your account immediately upon the borrowing order successfully being initiated.\n\n  6. Finally, you can enable the Auto-rollover feature and set your maximum expected rollover interest rate.\n\nRemember to repay loans from the previous VIP Loan by June 30, 2024. These\nloans are also displayed on the enhanced VIP Loan under the **Loan overview**\ntab.\n\nFor detailed product documentation on the enhanced VIP Loan, please click\n[here](/en-eu/help/viii-vip-loan).\n\nThis content is provided for informational purposes only.

    "title": "OKX to adjust the minimum order quantities for several futures",
    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **6:00 am - 8:00 am UTC on June\n6, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to step size will also be implemented.\n\nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (coins) (Before) | Minimum order\nquantity, step size (contracts) (After) | Minimum order quantity, step size\n(coins) (After)  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nPerpetual | FET/USDT | 1 | 10 | 0.1 | 1  \nPerpetual | SOL/USDT | 0.1 | 0.1 | 0.01 | 0.01  \nPerpetual | STX/USDT | 1 | 10 | 0.1 | 1  \nPerpetual | THETA/USDT | 1 | 10 | 0.1 | 1  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [_**Trad**_](/en-eu/trade-\nmarket/info/spot)[ _ **ing rules**_](/en-eu/trade-market/info/swap)  \n\nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n **1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**\n\nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures.\n\nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1\nETH, the updated step size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum\nfluctuation in the contracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01\nETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity.\n\nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH\nand a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity is set at 1\ncontract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be greater than or\nequal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in increments based on\nstep size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so on.\n\n2\\. **Display rules for open positions and open orders**\n\nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.\n\nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).  \n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n3\\. **Order processing rules**\n\nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.\n\nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).\n\nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).  \n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n4\\. **API interface adjustment rules**\n\nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).\n\nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)\n\nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

Adding offset structures for spot and derivatives orders (Offsetting orders in the Liquid Marketplace can significantly reduce the margin in use).\n\n  2.  **More flexible spot offset quantity adjustments** : Allow users to customize the number of spot assets included in the derivatives offset structure.\n\n  3.  **More accurate numerical calculations** : Conduct more accurate measurements for spot assets within the derivatives margin system and adjust the handling of spot assets during liquidations.\n\n    1.  **MMR calculation** : Includes the measurement of basis risk between spot assets/orders and derivatives positions/orders (MR4).  \n **Note: This may increase the maintenance margin, for example, in\ncombinations where spot assets are offset with perpetual, expiry futures, or\noptions.**\n\nPositions/Orders structure | Before | After  \n---|---|---  \nOpen positions:  \nBTC spot: 10 BTC  \nBTCUSDT perpetual: -1,000 contracts  \n  \nOrders:  \nBTC/USDT spot buy orders: Buy 5 BTC at a mark price | MR1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 = 0\nUSDT  \nMR7 = 3,020.87 USDT  \n  \n  \nMMR = Max [Max (MR1, MR2, MR6) + MR3 + MR4 + MR5, MR7)] = 3,020.87 USDT | MR1,\n2, 3, 5, 6 = 0 USDT  \nMR4 = 8,053.32 USDT  \nMR7 = 3,020.17 USDT  \n  \nMMR = Max [Max (MR1, MR2, MR6) + MR3 + MR4 + MR5, MR7)] = 8,053.32 USDT  \n  \n    2. **Liquidation engine** : Enhances the liquidation structure by incorporating a basis risk offsetting process between spot and derivatives positions.\n\n  4.  **More diverse offsetting modes** : Expand the spot offsetting function to all margin modes, including USDT/USDC/Crypto modes, supporting offsetting between spot assets and their corresponding USDC-margined risk units.\n\nThe table below illustrates the range of offsetting instruments for various\nmodes:\n\nOffset mode | ETH-USDT risk unit | ETH-USDC risk unit | ETH-USD risk unit  \n---|---|---|---  \nDerivatives  \n| ETHUSDT perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders)  \n| ETHUSDC perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders) | ETHUSD perpetual/expiry/options  \n(positions and orders)  \nSpot-derivatives (USDT)  \n| ETHUSDT perpetual/expiry, ETH spot assets, ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC spot orders\n| ETHUSDC perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders) | ETHUSD perpetual/expiry/options  \n(positions and orders)  \nSpot-derivatives (USDC)  \n| ETHUSDT perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders) | ETHUSDC perpetual/expiry (positions and orders), ETH\nspot assets, ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC spot orders | ETHUSDT perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders)  \nSpot-derivatives (crypto) | ETHUSDT perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders) | ETHUSDC perpetual/expiry  \n(positions and orders) | ETHUSD perpetual/expiry/options (positions and\norders), ETH spot assets, ETH/USDT and ETH/USDC spot orders  \n  \n* Derivatives (Expiry/Perpetual/Options) structures include both positions and orders.\n\n* Spot-derivatives risk offsetting USDT/USDC/Crypto mode: With this mode, spot assets and spot (USDT/USDC pairs) orders can be offset using corresponding USDT/USDC/Crypto as the margin risk unit.  \n\nDetails on the spot-derivatives risk offset updates and maintenance margin\nrules can be found on the [Portfolio margin mode: cross margin trading](/en-\neu/help/v-portfolio-margin-mode-cross-margin-trading) page.\n\nChanges to the API rules can be found on the [Set spot risk offset amount –\nOKX API guide | OKX technical support | OKX](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-\nsupport-customizing-spot-risk-offset-amount-set-spot-risk-offset-amount) page.  \n\nOKX team\n\nMay 31, 2024\n\n",

If the tick size is adjusted to a smaller decimal value (0.0001 to 0.01)\n\n    1. Limit orders: If your existing order has a larger decimal place than the adjusted tick size, your existing order will be canceled. If your existing order has a smaller or equal decimal place than the adjusted tick size, your existing order will not be canceled. For example, if tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, Existing Order 130.2442 will be canceled and Existing Order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n    2. Trading bots: If your existing order has a larger decimal place than the adjusted tick size, your existing order will be canceled. If your existing order has a smaller or equal decimal place than the adjusted tick size, your existing order will not be canceled. For example, if the tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, limit order 130.2442 will be canceled and limit order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n      1. For grid and DCA bots, any open orders you already placed with a trading bot will be canceled first (including spot grid, futures grid, moon grid, infinity grid, spot DCA, futures DCA), then the bots will be stopped.\n\n      2. For all other bots and order types (including singal Bot, recurring buy, TWAP, iceberg, smart portfolio, arbitrage, stop, trailing stop, trigger), your open orders will be canceled first, but the bots will not be affected. Your bots will resume trading with the new tick size after trading resumes.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to a larger decimal value (0.01 to 0.0001)\n\n    1. After the adjustment, existing orders, will be filled according to the adjusted tick size.\n\n **Note: The above rules are also applicable to orders placed using API.**\n\n  \nAfter the tick size is adjusted (for example, from 0.0001 to 0.01), if you\nplace an order with the previous tick size (0.0001) via API, the system will\nautomatically round down buy orders and round up sell orders so that the order\ncan be successfully placed. However, you will not be able to place orders\nusing the pre-adjusted tick size on the normal web and mobile interface.\n\n  \n **2) Open orders and the display of historical orders**\n\n  1. If the tick size is adjusted to smaller decimal places (0.0001 to 0.01): For non-API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the adjusted tick size by rounding down the buy orders and rounding up the sell orders. For API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed as the pre-adjustment tick size.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to larger decimal places (0.01 to 0.0001): Open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the original tick size.\n\n  \nYou are encouraged to adjust your trading strategies based on the above\nchanges.  \n\n **Risk warning:** The foregoing overview and information, some of which may\nbe provided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and\neducational purposes only.

    "title": "OKX to adjust the minimum order quantities for several futures",
    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **6:00 am - 8:00 am UTC on April\n18, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to step size will also be implemented.\n\nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts) (After)  \n---|---|---|---  \nPerpetual | ETH/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nExpiry | ETH/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [_**Trad**_](/en-eu/trade-\nmarket/info/spot)[ _ **ing rules**_](/en-eu/trade-market/info/swap)\n\n  \nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n  \n **1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**\n\nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1\nETH, the updated step size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum\nfluctuation in the contracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01\nETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity.\n\nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH\nand a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity is set at 1\ncontract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be greater than or\nequal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in increments based on\nstep size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so on.  \n\n **2\\. Display rules for open positions and open orders**\n\nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.\n\nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).  \n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)  \n\n **3\\. Order processing rules**\n\nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.\n\nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).\n\nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).  \n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)  \n\n **4\\. API interface adjustment rules**\n\nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).\n\nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)\n\nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **8:00 am - 10:00 am UTC on March\n28, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to step size will also be implemented.\n\nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts) (After)  \n---|---|---|---  \nPerpetual | ADA/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | ARB/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | AVAX/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | BCH/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | BSV/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | DOGE/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | ETC/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nExpiry | ETC/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | MKR/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | NEAR/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | PEPE/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | SOL/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | TRX/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | XRP/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \nExpiry | XRP/USDT | 1 | 0.1  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [_**Trad**_](/en-eu/trade-\nmarket/info/spot)[ _ **ing rules**_](/en-eu/trade-market/info/swap)\n\nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n ****\n\n **1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**\n\nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures. For instance, in\nthe ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH, the updated\nstep size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum fluctuation in the\ncontracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01 ETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity. For instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract\nsize of 0.1 ETH and a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity\nis set at 1 contract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be\ngreater than or equal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in\nincrements based on step size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so\non.\n\n **2\\. Display rules for open positions and open orders**\n\nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.\n\nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).\n\n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n **3\\. Order processing rules**\n\nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.\n\nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).\n\nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).\n\n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n **4\\. API interface adjustment rules**\n\nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).\n\nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)\n\n  \nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01)\n\n    1. Limit orders: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your pending order will not be canceled. For example, if tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, open order 130.2442 will be canceled and open order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n    2. Trading bots: If your open order has more decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will be canceled. If your open order has fewer or equal decimal places than the adjusted tick size, your open order will not be canceled. For example, if the tick size is adjusted from 0.0001 to 0.01, limit order 130.2442 will be canceled and limit order 130.24 will not be canceled.\n\n      1. For grid and DCA bots, any open orders you have already placed with a trading bot will be canceled first (including spot grid, futures grid, moon grid, infinity grid, spot DCA, and futures DCA), then the bots will be stopped.\n\n      2. For all other bots and order types (including signal bot, recurring buy, TWAP, iceberg, smart portfolio, arbitrage, stop, trailing stop, and trigger), your open orders will be canceled first, but the bots will not be affected. Your bots will resume trading with the new tick size after trading resumes.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001)\n\n    1. After the adjustment, open orders will be filled according to the adjusted tick size.\n\n **Note: The above rules are also applicable to orders placed using API.**\n\n  \nAfter the tick size is adjusted (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01), if you place an\norder with the previous tick size (0.0001) via API, the system will\nautomatically round down buy orders and round up sell orders so that the order\ncan be successfully placed. However, you will not be able to place orders\nusing the pre-adjusted tick size on the normal web and mobile interface.\n\n  \n **2) Open orders and the display of historical orders**\n\n  1. If the tick size is adjusted to fewer decimal places (e.g., from 0.0001 to 0.01): For non-API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the adjusted tick size by rounding down the buy orders and rounding up the sell orders. For API users, open orders and historical orders will be displayed as the pre-adjustment tick size.\n\n  2. If the tick size is adjusted to more decimal places (e.g., from 0.01 to 0.0001): Open orders and historical orders will be displayed with the original tick size.\n\n  \nYou are encouraged to adjust your trading strategies based on the above\nchanges.\n\n  \nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

    "title": "OKX to implement mandatory Self-Trade Prevention",
    "body": "Self-Trade Prevention (STP) aims to curb accidental self-trades, minimizing\nunnecessary trading fees and ensuring a compliant and fair trading\nenvironment.\n\nIn June 2023, OKX introduced STP as an optional feature for API users.\n\nFrom **10 am UTC on March 14, 2024** , OKX will mandate STP on a master\naccount basis for all new orders across all trading symbols and business\nlines. This will prohibit trades **between the same master account, between\nsub-accounts under the same master account, and between the same master\naccount and its affiliated sub-accounts**. For example, if master account A\nhas 2 sub-accounts, A1 and A2, trades between the following accounts will be\nprohibited:\n\n  * A with A\n  * A1 with A1\n  * A2 with A2\n  * A with A1\n  * A with A2\n  * A1 with A2\n\n**Key reminders:**\n\n  * The default STP mode will cancel maker orders. If a taker order leads to self-trading, the maker order on the order book will be canceled, while the taker order will match with subsequent orders.\n  * API users can select alternative STP modes by using the `stpMode` parameter with their new orders via the API endpoints for certain order types. Refer to the API documentation for details.\n  * Self-trades may still occur between orders created before and after mandatory STP implementation.\n  * For block trading, the maker will not receive the RFQ if the taker is under the same master account.\n  * You can find orders canceled due to STP by going to Order history on the OKX website or app. API users can query Order history REST endpoints or subscribe to the Orders WebSocket channel for this information.\n\n**Further references:**\n\n  * [Introducing Self-Trade Prevention: Better trading efficiency and protection for API users](/en-eu/help/how-do-i-prevent-self-trade-and-improve-my-api-trading-efficiency-and)\n  * [Mandatory STP - API upcoming changes](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-enabling-self-trade-prevention-by-default)\n\nOKX team\n\nFebruary 27, 2024\n\n",

    "body": "This week, between 9:07 and 9:09 am UTC on January 23, 2024, OKB spot trading\npairs experienced abnormal price volatility on our platform. This incident\nstarted when a substantially leveraged spot position was liquidated, which led\nto a domino effect liquidating multiple positions within flexible loan,\nmargined spot trading, and multi-currency margin trading products. Some of our\ncustomers who had open trades or were part of the force liquidation were\nimpacted.\n\nAs we advised [here](/en-eu/help/okx-to-adjust-discount-rates-for-several-\nassets-2024-01-24), OKX has adjusted its relevant risk parameters and we will\nadjust the accounts of eligible users that were impacted.\n\nSome of the eligible cases for account adjustment may include:\n\n  * Margined spot positions long OKB\n  * Flexible Loan with OKB as a collateral\n  * Cross positions with OKB margined under multi-currency margin accounts\n\nWe will automatically deposit funds into eligible users' funding accounts in\nUSDT before February 1, 2024.\n\n**Adjustment rules and calculation parameters**\n\nAccount adjustment for eligible users (to be determined at OKX's sole\ndiscretion) will cover the price difference loss, as calculated by OKX, that\nresulted from forced selling of OKB at a lower price during a liquidation and\nany liquidation penalties and transaction fees associated with the\nliquidation. For loans and positions with multiple collateral that included\nOKB, liquidation penalties and trading fees that were charged for the sale of\nthe other collateral or positions will also be reimbursed, subject to OKX's\ndiscretion. Bankruptcy losses covered by the insurance fund will be excluded.\n\n**A price difference loss** refers to a loss caused by the difference between\nthe mark price at 9:07:26am UTC (48.36 USDT) and the resulting liquidation\nprices during the period.\n\nFor example: If 10 OKB was liquidated at a liquidation price of 40.0 USDT, OKX\nwill compensate difference of (48.36 - 40.0) * 10 = 83.6 USDT. Compensation\nwill also include the associated liquidation penalty and trading fees (as\ndetermined by OKX), and exclude any bankruptcy losses already covered by the\ninsurance fund.\n\nFor any additional inquiries regarding adjustment or eligibility, please\ncontact us via the [Support Center](/en-eu/help).\n\nKind regards,\n\nOKX Team\n\n**Note: Not all users who held positions during the volatility period will be\ncompensated, only users who are determined to be eligible based on the above\noutlined criteria will be compensated.\n\n",

    "title": "OKX to change funding fee collection mechanism for remaining group of perpetual futures",
    "body": "To provide you with better services, OKX will gradually change the funding fee\ncollection mechanism for the remaining group of perpetual futures from cross-\nperiod collection to current-period collection. Perpetual futures that have\nalready changed to the current-period collection mechanism are listed in the\nfollowing announcement: [https://www.okx.com/help/okx-to-change-funding-fee-\ncollection-mechanism](/en-eu/help/okx-to-change-funding-fee-collection-\nmechanism)\n\n **Before the change:  \n** Formerly, funding fee calculations were based on the funding rate of the\nprevious funding period (cross-period collection). For example, when the\nfunding fee is collected every 8 hours, funding fee calculations at 8:00 am\nUTC today use the funding rate determined by the premium index from 4:00 pm\nUTC yesterday to 12:00 am UTC today, resulting in a fixed value from 12:00 am\nUTC to 8:00 am UTC.  \n  \n **After the change:  \n** Funding fee calculations will be based on the funding rate of the current\nfunding period (current-period collection).For example, funding fee\ncalculations at 8:00 am UTC every day will use the funding rate determined by\nthe premium index from 12:00 am UTC to 8:00 am UTC.

    "title": "OKX to adjust the minimum order quantities for several futures",
    "body": "To continually improve the trading experience and reduce costs for our\ntraders, OKX will adjust ‌the minimum order quantities for some perpetual and\nexpiry futures. This update is scheduled for **6:00 am - 10:00 am UTC on March\n14, 2024.** Corresponding adjustments to ‌step size will also be implemented.  \nThe specific adjustments are as follows:\n\nInstrument | Trading pair | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts)\n(Before) | Minimum order quantity, step size (contracts) (After)  \n---|---|---|---  \nExpiry | LTCUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | LTCUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \nPerpetual | SHIBUSDT | 1 | 0.1  \n  \nFor more information, please visit the OKX website: [Trading rules](/en-\neu/trade-market/info/swap)  \n  \nPlease note: All trading activities, including order placement, fund\ntransfers, and leverage adjustments, will remain unaffected during the\nadjustment period for step size and minimum order quantity.\n\n  \n**1\\. Understanding step size and minimum order quantity**  \nStep size is defined as the smallest possible increment or decrement in the\nnumber of contracts placed for perpetual and expiry futures.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1\nETH, the updated step size is set at 0.1 contracts. This means the minimum\nfluctuation in the contracts ordered is 0.1 contracts (equivalent to 0.01\nETH).\n\nMinimum order quantity is the smallest number of contracts permissible for an\norder in perpetual and expiry futures. It must be an integer multiple of the\nstep size. Traders must place orders equal to or larger than this minimum\norder quantity.  \nFor instance, in the ETHUSDT perpetual futures with a contract size of 0.1 ETH\nand a step size of 0.1 contracts, the minimum order quantity is set at 1\ncontract (0.1 ETH). This implies that order quantities must be greater than or\nequal to 1 contract (0.1 ETH), but can be increased in increments based on\n‌step size, such as 1.1 contracts, 1.2 contracts, and so on.\n\n  \n**2\\. Display rules for open positions and open orders**  \nUpon adjusting the step size, if the new step size is less than 1, both\nposition contract sizes and order quantities will be displayed in decimals.\nThis applies to unfulfilled, partially filled, completely filled, and open\norders, as well as the sizes of open positions.  \nFor instance, the SHIBUSDT perpetual futures has a contract size of 1,000,000\nSHIB. Currently, the step size is set at 1 contract, order quantity of 10\ncontracts (10,000,000 SHIB) and a position size of 1 contract (1,000,000\nSHIB). After adjusting the step size to 0.1 contracts, the order quantity will\nbe displayed as 10.5 contracts (10,500,000 SHIB) and the position size as 1.5\ncontracts (1,500,000 SHIB).  \n(This adjustment is applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n  \n**3\\. Order processing rules**  \nFor new orders, traders must ensure that the quantity placed or modified is an\nintegral multiple of the step size and at least equal to the minimum order\nquantity.  \nTake the SHIBUSDT perpetual contract as an example: with a contract size of\n1,000,000 SHIB, both the current step size and the minimum order quantity are\nset at 1 contract. This means that when placing or modifying orders, the\nquantities must be in integral multiples of 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB), with\nthe smallest permissible order being 1 contract (1,000,000 SHIB).  \nWhen the step size is adjusted to 0.1 contracts, any order placed or modified\nmust be in integral multiples of 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB); and after\nadjusting the minimum order quantity to 0.1 contracts, the order size must be\ngreater than or equal to 0.1 contracts (100,000 SHIB).  \n(These rules are also applicable to API users, bot traders, and copy traders.)\n\n  \n**4\\. API interface adjustment rules**  \nPost-adjustment, the API endpoint (/api/v5/public/instruments) and the\nWebSocket channel (Instruments) will reflect the updated values for step size\n(lotSz) and minimum order quantity (minSz).  \nMore details: [https://www.okx.com/docs-v5/log_en/#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts](/docs-v5/log_en#upcoming-changes-lot-size-\nchange-for-futures-contracts)\n\n  \nRisk warning: The foregoing overview and information, some of which may be\nprovided by third parties and not OKX, are for informational and educational\npurposes only.

Eligibility**\n\n  * Complete identity verification\n\n  * Stake at least 1 SUI to be eligible to receive airdrop rewards\n\n **2\\. Rules**\n\n  * Before the campaign starts, we'll take a snapshot of your SUI On-chain Earn subscriptions on **April 19, 2024** at 6:00 am UTC. This snapshot will determine your baseline holdings.\n\n  * We'll take daily snapshots at 6:00 am UTC of your On-chain Earn subscriptions during the campaign period. The average increased subscription amount from the baseline snapshot, or \"average increment\" will determine the size of your rewards. This means you should stake as much as possible as early as possible during the campaign period to maximize your rewards.\n\n  \n **3\\. Reward calculations**\n\n  * Your airdrop rewards = (Your average increment / Total average increment) × Prize pool\n\n  * Example (for illustrative purposes only):\n\n    * User A has 5 SUI staked during the initial snapshot taken on April 19.\n\n    * He stakes 5 SUI on the first day of the 14-day campaign, giving him a total of 10 SUI.\n\n    * He stakes another 5 SUI on day 7 of the campaign, giving him a total of 15 SUI. He does nothing else for the remainder of the campaign.\n\n    * User A's average increment is calculated as follows:\n\n      * (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15) / 14 - 5 = 7.5 SUI\n\n    * Assuming that the total average increment of users participating in the campaign is 1,000 SUI, and the prize pool is 10,000 SUI. User A's airdrop rewards will be calculated as follows:\n\n      * User A's airdrop rewards = (7.5 SUI / 1,000 SUI) × (10,000 SUI) = 75 SUI\n\n **4\\.

Reward distribution**\n\n  * You'll receive your airdrop rewards within 7 working days after the campaign period ends.\n\n  * All On-chain Earn staking interest will be distributed to your funding account depending on each token's on-chain mechanism.\n\n  * OKX has the discretion to convert any rewards into platform vouchers or USDT of equivalent value or less value. This may happen in cases where platform restrictions in certain jurisdictions cause participants to be ineligible for certain campaign rewards, where OKX is unable to procure the prizes for the participants, or in any case that OKX deems in its full discretion that it's necessary for the rewards to be converted.\n\n  \n **Disclaimer**\n\n  * OKX and collaborated third-party providers provide node setup, operation, and maintenance services for On-chain Earn product staking, and bear all related costs.

    "body": "OKX is launching an exclusive airdrop campaign for SOL, DOT, MATIC and TRX\nOnchain Earn products users on **January 11, 2024 at 12:00 am UTC**.\n\n**Campaign details**  \n **1\\. Eligibility**\n\n  * Campaign period: January 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) to January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC).\n  * Users must stake the airdrop tokens in the following amounts to receive any rewards：\n    * SOL: at least 1 SOL\n    * DOT: at least 2 DOT\n    * MATIC: at least 1 MATIC\n    * TRX: at least 20 TRX\n\n**2\\. Rules**\n\n  * Before the campaign starts, we'll take a snapshot of your SOL, DOT, MATIC, and TRX On-chain Earn subscriptions on January 11, 2024 at 06:00 (UTC). This snapshot will determine your baseline holdings.\n  * We'll take daily snapshots (taken at 12:00 UTC) of your On-chain Earn subscriptions during the campaign period. The average increased subscription amount from the baseline snapshot, or \"average increment\" will determine the size of your rewards. This means you must stake as much as possible as early as possible during the campaign period to maximize your rewards.\n\n**3\\. Reward calculations**\n\n  * Your airdrop reward = (Your average increment) / (Total average increment) × (Prize pool)\n  * Example (for illustrative purposes only):\n    * User A has 5 SOL staked during the initial snapshot taken on January 11.\n    * He stakes 5 SOL on the first day of the 14-day campaign, giving him a total of 10 SOL.\n    * He stakes another 5 SOL on day 7 of the campaign, giving him a total of 15 SOL. He does nothing else for the remainder of the campaign.\n    * User A's average increment is calculated as follows:\n      * (10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15) / 14 - 5 = 7.5 SOL.\n    * Assuming that the total average increment of users participating in the campaign is 1,000 SOL, and the prize pool is 10,000 SOL, user A's airdrop rewards will be calculated as follows:\n      * User A's airdrop rewards = (7.5 SOL) / (1,000 SOL) × (10,000 SOL) = 75 SOL\n\n**4\\. Schedule and prize details**\n\nCampaign period | Prize pool | Token  \n---|---|---  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 250 SOL |\nSOL  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 14,000\nMATIC | MATIC  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 2,000 DOT\n| DOT  \nJanuary 11, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) - January 25, 2024 at 12:00 (UTC) | 250,000\nTRX | TRX  \n  \n**5\\. Reward distribution**\n\n  * You'll receive your airdrop rewards within 15 working days in the form of a free On-chain Earn subscription after the campaign period ends. The prize will be labeled \"airdrop reward\". \n  * All On-chain Earn staking interest will be distributed to your funding account depending on each token's on-chain mechanism.\n  * OKX has the discretion to convert any rewards into platform vouchers or USDT of equivalent value or less value. This may happen in cases where platform restrictions in certain jurisdictions cause participants to be ineligible for certain campaign rewards, where OKX is unable to procure the prizes for the participants, or in any case that OKX deems in its full discretion that it's necessary for the rewards to be converted.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n  * OKX and collaborated third-party providers provide node setup, operation, and maintenance services for On-chain Earn product staking, and bear all related costs. On-chain Earn product staking rewards are subject to fluctuations, and will be distributed based on ‌on-chain conditions.\n  * Participation with sub-accounts is forbidden.\n\n**Terms and conditions:**\n\n  1. By default, users who enter the campaign page and participate in this campaign have read and understood the Terms and Conditions of this campaign.\n  2. Participation in this campaign is restricted to the main account only. Sub-accounts are not eligible to participate. The earnings of sub-accounts will not be included in the calculation of the earnings of the main account.\n  3.

The value of any reward under this Campaign at the time a participant qualifies for such reward may not be equal to the value of such reward at the time of distribution to the participant. Due to such fluctuations, users may experience a significant increase or decrease in the value of their assets at any given moment.\n  11. OKX reserves the right to determine and amend the rules of the campaign at any time without further notice, including but not limited to cancelling, extending or terminating this campaign, modifying the eligibility conditions for users participating in the campaign, and adjusting the campaign and Reward rules.

    "body": "We've recently observed significant volatility in the MANTRA (OM) token.\nFollowing a sharp rise in its price beginning in early November 2024, the\ntoken experienced an initial sudden and substantial price decline of more than\n80% across the market at approximately 2:28:32am (UTC+8) on April 14, 2025 (\"\n**Market Event** \"). We observed that substantial trading volume spikes and\nprice decline initially happened across various centralised exchanges outside\nof OKX, before spreading to the overall market.\n\nFollowing the incident, we have conducted investigations and identified major\nchanges to the MANTRA token’s tokenomics model since Oct 2024, based on both\npublicly available on-chain data and internal exchange data. Our investigation\nalso uncovered that several on-chain addresses have been executing potentially\ncoordinated large-scale deposits and withdrawals across various centralized\nexchanges since Mar 2025.\n\nIn light of the above-mentioned market risks, we have adjusted a number of\nplatform risk control parameters to mitigate potential impacts. We'd also like\nto remind users that the current market environment involves heightened risk.\nCertain tokens may experience significant changes in supply, which could\nresult in considerable price volatility. Users are advised to conduct thorough\ndue diligence and exercise caution when engaging in trading activities.\n\nA risk warning has been added to the OM token page to inform users of its\nincreased volatility.\n\nWe'll continue to closely monitor this situation and implement appropriate\nrisk management measures to safeguard user interests and uphold platform\nstability.

The update is scheduled for 8:00 am\nUTC on March 5, 2024 and will not affect other calculation logic or change the\noutcome during funding rate settlement.\n\n  \nFunding rate formula:\n\nFunding rate = Clamp[Average premium index, Funding cap, Funding floor]  \nTo elaborate further,  \nAverage premium index = MA(Premium index – Interest rate)  \nInterest rate = 0  \nPremium index = [(Best bid + Best offer) / 2 – Index price] / Index price  \nMA refers to the moving average and it is calculated every minute\n\n  \n **Before the switch：**\n\nFunding rate will be calculated using the premium index of each minute from\nthe start of the period to present.
